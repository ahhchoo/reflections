1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize repo with git init, you make a new repo with 0 commits. You do it beacuse if you want to work with multiple files who work together, repo helps monitor changes.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging Area allows user to upload multiple files into one commit.


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Because the staging area allows you to insert multiple files into one commit, you can 
make one logical change before putting all files onto the staging area again. 

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help keep history oragnized in situations where:
a. you wanna test an experimental code
b. use code in different languages

Branches keep track of these changes without changing original code. 

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams let user trace the branch from tip to parent. Diagrams also let user see the reachability of the commits.

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do? 

Result of merging two branches together -> combining final results of files after branching. 
This enables people who've worked on multipe features to join them into the new master. 
A diagram allows you to trace the commits and its parents.
